Analysis of Burn Severity relative to forest cover. NDVI pre-burn calculated, and dNBR calculated prior to burn (dNBR is just a ratio of veg cover change, so dNBR in unburned area may be more reflective of forest treatments than just change in NDVI). 

Need to figure out why the dNBR_treat layer seems to also include the burn severity data. dNBR_treat should mostly be yellow/smaller changes in veg cover over the last year.
